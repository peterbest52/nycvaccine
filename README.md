# NYC COVID-19 Vaccine Finder

## Background
Vaccination is the primary preventive measure to battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. In New York City (NYC), reaching a vaccination clinic is highly reliant on public transit. This Jupyter notebook helps to locate COVID-19 vaccine resources near a public transit station (metro or bus) in NYC. 

You can access the notebook at the CyberGISX website:

## Instructions
* You need to specify a buffer distance (e.g., 2 miles) and a target public transit station ID (e.g., 500) to search and identify the COVID-19 vaccines near the station.
* The vaccine location data for NYC are provided for you. If you want to replicate the project for another study area, you need to webscrape the vaccine location data and geocode the data for that study area. Please refer to the two other notebooks for details.
