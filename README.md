# NYC COVID-19 Vaccine Finder

## Background
Vaccination is the primary preventive measure to battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. In New York City (NYC), reaching a vaccination clinic is highly reliant on public transit. This Jupyter notebook helps to locate COVID-19 vaccine resources near a public transit station (metro or bus) in NYC. 

You can access the notebook on the *CyberGISX* website:

## Instructions
* You need to specify a buffer distance (e.g., 2 miles) and a target public transit station ID (e.g., 500) to search and identify the COVID-19 vaccines near the station.
* The vaccination clinic data in NYC are provided for you. If you want to replicate the project for another study area, you need to webscrape the vaccination location data and geocode the data for that study area. Please refer to the following notebooks for details.
