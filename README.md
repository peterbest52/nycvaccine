# NYC COVID-19 Vaccine Finder

## Background
Vaccination is the primary preventive measure to battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. In New York City (NYC), reaching a vaccination clinic is highly reliant on public transit. This Jupyter notebook helps to locate COVID-19 vaccine resources near a public transit station (metro or bus) in NYC. You can access the notebook at CyberGISX website. 

## Instruction
You need to specify the buffer distance (e.g., 2 miles) and a target public transit station ID (e.g., 500) to search and identify the COVID-19 vaccines near the station.
